**What this app is.** A local-only training notebook: write a plan, log what you actually
did against it, and let the app show you the difference and what to do next. No account, no
server, and nothing leaves the device unless you export it.

Feature ids (`F#` foundations, `B#` defects, `N#` the next planned changes,
`P#.#` the product backlog, `R#.#` releases) are stable and are referenced from
commit messages. They were assigned when the work was planned, so they do not run in
order — the `P4`/`P5` rows are simply the ones parked furthest out, and `N1`–`N28` have
shipped and left the file.

## Current state

- **The whole loop works and is released**: start a workout, log sets, see the
  history, get the data out. What that includes at any moment is
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)'s job, not this file's — an enumerated feature list is
  precisely the kind of fact that drifts.
- **Local only.** No `INTERNET` permission, `allowBackup="false"`, no accounts, no
  analytics; the export file is the only path off the device.
- **Releases are manual**, signed with a permanent local key. The procedure and its
  traps are in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), including why automation was declined.
- **One module, one activity**, Compose + Room + Hilt. Compose UI tests run on the
  JVM under Robolectric rather than on a device.
## Next

**One thing is marked for work — N29, repeating the last workout in one tap.** Everything else from
the v1.5 review and the round after it (B26–B32, N26, N27, N28) shipped, and what they did is in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Past N29 the next round is a choice rather than a queue: the rest is in
*Later*, below.

### N29 — Repeat the last workout in one tap — **built, tests outstanding**

Was **P1.15**. Templates cover the planned session; this covers the unplanned one — "same as last
time" is the most common thing a lifter does, and today it costs picking six exercises out of the
library again.

- **Where:** home's start action, which already offers *Start workout* and *Start from template*.
  *Repeat last workout* joins them, offered only when a finished session exists to repeat.
- **What it copies: the exercises and their order, nothing else.** Not last session's weights as
  targets — progression (N22) and the "last time" prefill already answer that, and freezing a
  week's numbers as a plan would put the two in conflict. Recorded because copying the load is the
  obvious wrong turn.
- **It reuses the append path** the picker and templates use, so a repeated exercise is the same
  row a manual add would have produced rather than a second kind of row.
- **A resumed session wins.** When a workout is already open, home shows *Resume* and the repeat
  action is not offered: the atomic find-or-create would protect it anyway, but the UI should not
  present a choice that does nothing.
- **Edge cases the tests should hold:** with no finished session the action is absent; an exercise
  since soft-deleted is skipped while the rest repeat; and the same exercise twice in the old
  workout repeats twice, because that is what was performed.

The action, the route flag, the ViewModel branch and the repository path are in. Two of the three edge
cases live in the SQL (the library join drops a deleted exercise, and there is deliberately no
`DISTINCT`), so the tests that hold them belong against a real database — the instrumented suite,
where the last-session query can be seeded.

### N25 — A session remembers the timezone it was performed in

**In progress.** The offset is stored on the session, captured once when it opens, and carried in the
backup file. History already reads it: a workout is grouped under the month *it* was performed in.
Read by history (grouping and the row date), the workout detail and the finish review. The trends
window turned out to need nothing: it buckets by instant and never formats a session's own time.
A seeded 16→17 migration test proves an upgrade keeps the rows already there and leaves their zone
**null** rather than backfilled; run on a device: 17 tests in the class, no failures.

Still to do: a device pass on the formatting itself — the emulator's clock is UTC, so seeing a Tokyo
session read as Tokyo needs the device's zone moved first.

**The backfill is deliberately null.** A session performed before the column existed cannot be given
an offset after the fact, so those keep showing the current zone: the same thing they always showed.

## Later (still self-contained)

Post-MVP, same local-only premise. Grouped by theme, ordered by value inside each.

This is where candidates live. One graduates to *Next* — gaining a `B#` or `N#` id and
a spelled-out decision — when it is picked up, and leaves for
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when it ships.

**Insight** — why the app gets opened between workouts
- **P2.4** Body measurements.

**Programming** — turns a logger into a plan
- **P3.3** Programs / mesocycles with scheduled deloads.
- **P3.5** Planned-versus-completed adherence over a longer window, and a calendar view —
  the weekly schedule itself shipped as **N16**, and session-level plan-versus-actual is
  **N20**.

Templates shipped their v1 as **N3**, and their targets, per-plan rest and weekday schedule
as **N14–N16**. Auto-progression shipped as **N22**, and supersets as **N24**.

The **accessibility rule still applies to every screen as it is written**
([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)); the audit sweep that used to sit here is parked, so this
section is empty until it returns or something replaces it.

Design-system work (**F8**) is a rule rather than a row now: extract a component when
a second screen needs it, not before.

## Parked — deliberately not planned

Each is a product in its own right, contradicts "local-only", or both. Parking is a
decision, not a backlog. Every row names what would change it.

Parked is **not** the same as the non-goals below: these become possible again the
moment their trigger fires, while a non-goal is a line this app does not cross.

| # | Feature | Revisit only if |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P4.1 | Health Connect read/write | A user asks to share with a platform health graph. It is a sharing integration; this app stores data for its user. |
| P4.2 | Foreground service | The rest timer needs to survive something the alarm and the in-app timer cannot. |
| P4.3 | Home-screen widget | The glance it would give turns out to be the missing thing. |
| P4.4 | Quick Settings / launcher shortcuts | Starting a routine becomes frequent enough to deserve a second entry point. |
| P4.5 | Wear OS companion | Wrist logging is genuinely wanted — and you accept `play-services-wearable`, which breaks the no-GMS line. |
| P4.6 | Bluetooth heart-rate straps | The product becomes heart-rate training rather than logging. |
| P4.7 | WorkManager reminders | Nudges demonstrably improve adherence. |
| P4.8 | Large-screen layouts | Tablet or foldable users actually appear. |
| P4.9 | Offline-first sync | There is a real multi-device story. It needs a backend, accounts and conflict resolution — the largest irreversible commitment on this list. |
| P3.7, P5.2 | Friends, shared routines | Accounts, servers and moderation become worth owning. |
| P5.3 | Monetization / Play Billing | There is a concrete reason to charge, and a willingness to take the Play-services dependency. |
| P5.4 | Localization | A non-English user appears. |
| P1.11 | Onboarding: goal, experience level, weekly target | This stops being a single-user local tool with one obvious user. It personalises defaults, and there are no defaults to personalise. |
| P1.9 | kg/lb display setting | You start lifting in pounds. Storage is canonical grams, so this is display-only whenever it is wanted. |
| P1.17 | Accessibility audit | The per-screen rule stops being enough — a real complaint on a device, or a screen that grew past ad-hoc tagging. The rule itself still applies to every change; only the sweep is parked. |
| P2.5 | Progress photos | A visual record is actually wanted, and an encrypted-storage design for it is acceptable. |
| P2.8 | Muscle-group balance warnings | Enough history exists for a rolling window to say something true rather than something plausible. |
| P2.6 | Plate calculator | Loading from a plan's target is frequent enough that the arithmetic gets in the way, and you would rather it were done for you. |
| — | **Play Store listing** | You want distribution beyond `adb install`. Self-install works today, and Play App Signing would change who holds the signing key. |
| — | **Encryption at rest / app lock** | You start carrying the phone somewhere you would not carry the data. |
| F6 | Module split into `:core:*` / `:feature:*` | **A named goal, not a refactor**: a measured build-time problem, working on one feature without compiling the rest, or a second surface (Wear, a widget). Revisited after v1.2 and re-affirmed. |
| F11b | Product analytics | Almost certainly never: on a single-user local tool it buys nothing, and it would breach the no-`INTERNET` line. |

## Explicit non-goals

Permanent, unlike *Parked* above: nutrition / calorie tracking, social feeds, live GPS
route tracking, and a web dashboard. Each is a product in its own right and would
dilute the logging core.

## Keeping this true

Four rules. The drift they prevent has now happened four times — stale test counts, a
dependency inventory, an enumerated feature list that v1.3 quietly outgrew, and a
review stamp still reading v1.3 while *Next* said "Nothing" after v1.4 had shipped
with defects unfound. Two of those four were this file describing itself wrongly:

1. **Nothing marked done lives here.** Shipped work goes to
   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and a finished row is deleted from this file.
2. **No hand-maintained facts.** No test counts, no dependency lists, no inventory of
   which files exist. Those are commands (`./gradlew …`) or links
   ([libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml), [app/schemas](app/schemas)).
3. **Every parked row names its revisit trigger**, so parking reads as a decision
   rather than a forgotten item.
4. **Durable content lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).** Settled decisions and the
   rules that apply to every change are a reference, not a queue, and the two age
   differently. A section here that accumulates rather than drains belongs there.

Bump the review stamp at the top whenever this file is checked against the code.
