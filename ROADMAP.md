# Workout — Roadmap

> **v1.6** is shipped and installed. Last reviewed against the code: 2026-10-01.
>
> This file is forward-looking only. What shipped lives in
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); how a release is cut lives in
> [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md); settled decisions and the rules that apply to every
> change live in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

**What this app is.** A local-only training notebook: write a plan, log what you actually
did against it, and let the app show you the difference and what to do next. No account, no
server, and nothing leaves the device unless you export it.

Feature ids (`F#` foundations, `B#` defects, `N#` the next planned changes,
`P#.#` the product backlog, `R#.#` releases) are stable and are referenced from
commit messages. They were assigned when the work was planned, so they do not run in
order — the `P4`/`P5` rows are simply the ones parked furthest out, and `N1`–`N29` have
shipped and left the file.

## Current state

- **The whole loop works and is released**: start a workout, log sets, see the
  history, get the data out. What that includes at any moment is
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)'s job, not this file's — an enumerated feature list is
  precisely the kind of fact that drifts.
- **Local only.** No `INTERNET` permission, `allowBackup="false"`, no accounts, no
  analytics; the export file is the only path off the device.
- **Releases are manual**, signed with a permanent local key. The procedure and its
  traps are in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), including why automation was declined.
- **One module, one activity**, Compose + Room + Hilt. Compose UI tests run on the
  JVM under Robolectric rather than on a device.

## Next

**N30 is the one item still needing work**, and behind it are **B33–B43** — what a review of the v1.6
batch found, defects and improvements together. Everything else has shipped and left this file: the
v1.5 review's corrections (B26–B32), the round after it (N26–N28), repeating the last workout (N29) and
the session timezone (N25). What they did is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Past these the next round
is a choice rather than a queue: the rest is in *Later*, below.

### N30 — Finish the rename: the repository has no description, and nothing has validated it

The rename itself shipped — the app is **Workout**, the repository is `997volt/workout`, the old URL
redirects, and the local remote points at the new one. Two loose ends, both small and neither a code
change.

- **Fill in the repository's description and topics — done.** The description says what the app is and
  what it does not do: *"Plan a workout, log what you actually did, and see the difference. Local-only:
  no account, no server, no permissions at all."* Topics: `android`, `kotlin`, `jetpack-compose`, `room`,
  `offline-first`, `local-first`, `workout-tracker`. Both read back from the API rather than assumed.
- **Get one green CI run over the rename — still open, and close to self-inflicted.** Every run since
  the rename has been cancelled by the next push: twelve in a row at the last check, with the tip
  *pending*. Nothing is wrong with the pipeline — this is the cancellation already accepted and recorded
  in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) — and it closes as soon as pushes stop for twenty minutes. The commit
  that carries this note deliberately was **not pushed**, so the run in flight can finish.

### The v1.6 review — the features (B33–B37)

**B33–B38 and B40–B43 are fixed**, and B34's and B41's fixes are device-verified and live in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the rest are open. The batch that shipped N25–N29 was reviewed function by function. Two defects are user-visible, the
rest are the removal and the tests that came with it. Ordered by what they cost.

- **B39 — Test what a screen renders, not only how it groups.** N25's grouping is well covered —
  `GroupByMonthTest` holds the Tokyo/London month boundary both ways — while no test asserts the date
  any screen actually displays, and there is no `HistoryFormat` test at all. The grouping was right and
  the rendering was wrong, so the thorough half was the half that did not need it.
- **"The last workout" has no tiebreaker.** Both the repeat query and `observeHistory` order by
  `finishedAt DESC` alone (`SessionExerciseDao.kt:55`, `WorkoutDao.kt:83`), so when two sessions share a
  `finishedAt` — plausible after a backup import, which round-trips the value — the workout at the top
  of Recent need not be the one Repeat picks. A secondary sort key on either side settles it.
- **A repeat can be offered that opens an empty session.** `canRepeat` only asks whether history is
  non-empty (`WorkoutsHomeScreen.kt:197`), while the query also requires live exercises, so a last
  session whose exercises were all deleted yields a button indistinguishable from *Start workout*.
  Contrived — finishing requires a logged set — but the two conditions should agree.

## Later (still self-contained)

Post-MVP, same local-only premise. Grouped by theme, ordered by value inside each.

This is where candidates live. One graduates to *Next* — gaining a `B#` or `N#` id and
a spelled-out decision — when it is picked up, and leaves for
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when it ships.

**Insight** — why the app gets opened between workouts
- **P2.4** Body measurements.

**Programming** — turns a logger into a plan
- **P3.3** Programs / mesocycles with scheduled deloads.
- **P3.5** Planned-versus-completed adherence over a longer window, and a calendar view —
  the weekly schedule itself shipped as **N16**, and session-level plan-versus-actual is
  **N20**.

Templates shipped their v1 as **N3**, and their targets, per-plan rest and weekday schedule
as **N14–N16**. Auto-progression shipped as **N22**, and supersets as **N24**.

The **accessibility rule still applies to every screen as it is written**
([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)); the audit sweep that used to sit here is parked, so this
section is empty until it returns or something replaces it.

Design-system work (**F8**) is a rule rather than a row now: extract a component when
a second screen needs it, not before.

## Parked — deliberately not planned

Each is a product in its own right, contradicts "local-only", or both. Parking is a
decision, not a backlog. Every row names what would change it.

Parked is **not** the same as the non-goals below: these become possible again the
moment their trigger fires, while a non-goal is a line this app does not cross.

| # | Feature | Revisit only if |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P4.1 | Health Connect read/write | A user asks to share with a platform health graph. It is a sharing integration; this app stores data for its user. |
| P4.2 | Foreground service | The rest timer needs to survive something the alarm and the in-app timer cannot. |
| P4.3 | Home-screen widget | The glance it would give turns out to be the missing thing. |
| P4.4 | Quick Settings / launcher shortcuts | Starting a routine becomes frequent enough to deserve a second entry point. |
| P4.5 | Wear OS companion | Wrist logging is genuinely wanted — and you accept `play-services-wearable`, which breaks the no-GMS line. |
| P4.6 | Bluetooth heart-rate straps | The product becomes heart-rate training rather than logging. |
| P4.7 | WorkManager reminders | Nudges demonstrably improve adherence. |
| P4.8 | Large-screen layouts | Tablet or foldable users actually appear. |
| P4.9 | Offline-first sync | There is a real multi-device story. It needs a backend, accounts and conflict resolution — the largest irreversible commitment on this list. |
| P3.7, P5.2 | Friends, shared routines | Accounts, servers and moderation become worth owning. |
| P5.3 | Monetization / Play Billing | There is a concrete reason to charge, and a willingness to take the Play-services dependency. |
| P5.4 | Localization | A non-English user appears. |
| P1.11 | Onboarding: goal, experience level, weekly target | This stops being a single-user local tool with one obvious user. It personalises defaults, and there are no defaults to personalise. |
| P1.9 | kg/lb display setting | You start lifting in pounds. Storage is canonical grams, so this is display-only whenever it is wanted. |
| P1.17 | Accessibility audit | The per-screen rule stops being enough — a real complaint on a device, or a screen that grew past ad-hoc tagging. The rule itself still applies to every change; only the sweep is parked. |
| P2.5 | Progress photos | A visual record is actually wanted, and an encrypted-storage design for it is acceptable. |
| P2.8 | Muscle-group balance warnings | Enough history exists for a rolling window to say something true rather than something plausible. |
| P2.6 | Plate calculator | Loading from a plan's target is frequent enough that the arithmetic gets in the way, and you would rather it were done for you. |
| — | **Play Store listing** | You want distribution beyond `adb install`. Self-install works today, and Play App Signing would change who holds the signing key. |
| — | **Encryption at rest / app lock** | You start carrying the phone somewhere you would not carry the data. |
| F6 | Module split into `:core:*` / `:feature:*` | **A named goal, not a refactor**: a measured build-time problem, working on one feature without compiling the rest, or a second surface (Wear, a widget). Revisited after v1.2 and re-affirmed. |
| F11b | Product analytics | Almost certainly never: on a single-user local tool it buys nothing, and it would breach the no-`INTERNET` line. |

## Explicit non-goals

Permanent, unlike *Parked* above: nutrition / calorie tracking, social feeds, live GPS
route tracking, and a web dashboard. Each is a product in its own right and would
dilute the logging core.

## Keeping this true

Four rules. The drift they prevent has now happened four times — stale test counts, a
dependency inventory, an enumerated feature list that v1.3 quietly outgrew, and a
review stamp still reading v1.3 while *Next* said "Nothing" after v1.4 had shipped
with defects unfound. Two of those four were this file describing itself wrongly:

1. **Nothing marked done lives here.** Shipped work goes to
   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and a finished row is deleted from this file.
2. **No hand-maintained facts.** No test counts, no dependency lists, no inventory of
   which files exist. Those are commands (`./gradlew …`) or links
   ([libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml), [app/schemas](app/schemas)).
3. **Every parked row names its revisit trigger**, so parking reads as a decision
   rather than a forgotten item.
4. **Durable content lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).** Settled decisions and the
   rules that apply to every change are a reference, not a queue, and the two age
   differently. A section here that accumulates rather than drains belongs there.

Bump the review stamp at the top whenever this file is checked against the code.
